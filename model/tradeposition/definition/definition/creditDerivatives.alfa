    /# Field 2.149 - Defined lower point at which the level of losses in the underlying portfolio reduces the notional of a tranche. For example, the notional 
        in a tranche with an attachment point of 3% will be reduced after 3% of losses in the portfolio have occurred. This data element is not applicable 
        if the transaction is not a CDS tranche transaction (index or custom basket).#/

    /# Field 2.150 - Defined point beyond which losses in the underlying portfolio no longer reduce the notional of a tranche. For example, the notional in a tranche 
        with an attachment point of 3% and a detachment point of 6% will be reduced after there have been 3% of losses in the portfolio. 6% losses in the portfolio deplete the notional of the tranche.
        This data element is not applicable if the transaction is not a CDS tranche transaction (index or custom basket).#/
